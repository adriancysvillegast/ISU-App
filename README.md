IMPORTANT:
I couldn't add events to google calendar, also google places didn't work how was expected these sdks gave me some error for api_key or scopes. 
i tried everything but it didn't work, i belive that the problem could be I don't have and verified acount. 
to have one you must add a visa card and for venezuela it isn't allowed, i tried with my zinli card but google don't allow that type of cards.
i read some docummentation and i see that when you don't have a verified account you could have some problems with the sdks and api.
